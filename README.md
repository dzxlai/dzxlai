<h1>Hi, I'm Dom! </h1>

I am a MSc graduate in Data Science from UoBirmingham, and prior to this, I obtained a BSc in Mathematics from the UoSussex. Since the completion of my MSc I have developed a passion for analysis and am eager to begin a career within this field.
Through my educational background, I have developed a strong foundation in Python, SQL and Excel and would love the opportunity to further grow my technical toolbox.
<br/>

I am a hard worker and incredibly eager to learn, and aspire to apply the strengths and skills I have built up from academia in data analytics to real-world problems.
Here you'll find recent projects I have been working on, showcasing the skills and experiences I have built over and after education.
<br/>

Looking to begin a full-time postion and relocate to Central London.
Thank you for your time and consideration, please feel free to get in touch with me using any of my contact details below regarding any analytics opportunites!
